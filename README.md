This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/chetali-1004/portfolio.git
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Run locally (localhost)
```bash
npm run dev
```
To test on any other device:
  1. Find IP address of your laptop.
  2. See the port number on which localhost is running
  3. Enter the url on your mobile as - IP_addr:Port_num
     Eg- IP address - 172.11.2.3
         Port number - 3000
         Enter 172.11.2.3:3000 on the device
  4. If this does not work, try connecting your other device and laptop to the same network
